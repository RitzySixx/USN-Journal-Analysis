# ShadowAC1 - USN Journal Tampering Detector

A comprehensive Windows forensic tool for detecting tampering with NTFS USN (Update Sequence Number) Journals. Helps identify potential anti-forensic activities and system manipulation attempts.

## üîç Overview

ShadowAC1 analyzes NTFS USN Journals to detect evidence of tampering, deletion, clearing, or manipulation. USN Journals are critical for forensic analysis as they maintain a record of file system changes that attackers often target to hide their activities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Journal Deletion Detection** - Identifies missing or deleted USN journals
- **Journal Clearing Detection** - Detects cleared or reset journal entries  
- **Timestamp Analysis** - Compares USN records with MFT timestamps
- **Gap Detection** - Identifies suspicious gaps in USN sequences
- **Event Log Correlation** - Cross-references with Windows event logs
- **Baseline Comparison** - Tracks changes over time
- **Multi-Volume Support** - Analyzes all NTFS volumes on the system

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
ShadowAC1.exe
```

The tool automatically performs a 5-phase analysis:
1. **USN Journal Analysis**
2. **Event Log Analysis**  
3. **Journal Manipulation Detection**
4. **Baseline Comparison**
5. **Report Generation**
